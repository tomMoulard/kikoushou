## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Feature ideas and UX enhancements with focus on actionable solutions

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing:** Embody different user personas (organizer, casual guest, driver, passenger) to surface hidden UX needs
2. **SCAMPER Method:** Systematically enhance existing features through Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse
3. **Cross-Pollination:** Transfer successful patterns from related apps (Airbnb, Splitwise, Google Calendar, Uber)

**AI Rationale:** Multi-user coordination apps benefit from perspective-taking to understand diverse needs, systematic feature analysis, and learning from proven solutions in adjacent domains.
